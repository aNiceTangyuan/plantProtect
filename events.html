        <p>Every 4 years or so an International Plant Protection Congress (IPPC) brings together plant protection specialists from around the world to discuss the science and practice of plant protection. It was in 1946 that the first IPPC was held, <a href="#"><span>in Louvain, Belgium.</span></a></p>
        <p>The prime focus of Congresses through to 1975 was on new means of controlling insects, with some discussion relating to the chemical control of diseases. Most participants at those early IPPCs were entomologists. The Congress held in Washington, DC in 1979 was the first IPPC organized by a multidisciplinary group, consisting of plant pathologists, entomologists, weed scientists, nematologists and chemists; the integration of these disciplines was reflected in the program.</p>
        <div style="clear: both;"></div>
        <p>Since 1979 the IPPCs have been broadly multidisciplinary with an emphasis on an integrated approach to plant protection. Thus, for over 50 years the IPPCs have provided a forum for plant protection scientists to communicate and discuss important problems and new discoveries related to crop losses due to pests and their management.</p>
        <p>Historical details concerning past International Plant Protection Congresses, include a table of <strong><a href="#">IPPC Statistics (1946 -)</a></strong> and a series of <strong><a href="#">historical reports.</a></strong></p>
        <p>Information about the next IPPC is provided <a href=""><span>here.</span></a> If you are interested in making an application to host the following IPPC in 2027, further details about how to apply are provided <a href=""><span>here.</span></a></p>

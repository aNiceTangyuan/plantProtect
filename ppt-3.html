        <p>As the science of plant protection developed an increasing number of scientific disciplines have become involved. This enabled the full dimensions of plant protection problems and opportunities could be appreciated and a range of tools and approaches developed to enable problems to be resolved in an economic and sustainable way. Scientists from the following disciplines have become involved:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><em><strong>Biologists</strong></em> working on pest organisms such as insects, diseases, nematodes and weeds are required for identifying pest species, and understanding their population dynamics and the natural factors that influence their abundance.</li>
          <li><em><strong>Agronomists</strong></em> are involved in determining the impact that pest attack has on the yield and quality of crops and the role of plant tolerance and compensation in ameliorating the damage caused by pests</li>
          <li><em><strong>Chemists and engineers</strong></em> are required to develop new pesticides and bio-pesticides and to design pesticide application technologies that effectively deliver the pesticide to the target pest.</li>
          <li><em><strong>Genetic engineers</strong></em> are increasingly involved in developing molecular identification techniques and genetically modified crops that have in-built resistance to pest attack</li>
          <li><em><strong>Information Technology and communication experts</strong></em> are involved in developing on-line identification aids and providing new communication technologies</li>
          <li><em><strong>Social scientists</strong></em>, including economists and sociologists investigate the various on-farm and off-farm factors that affect the feasibility and economic outcomes of crop protection strategies, including the information, training and political opportunities and constraints to improved plant protection.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The IAPPS approach</h3>
        <p>To implement an <strong><a href="">Integrated Approach to Plant Protection</a></strong>, IAPPS encourages an interdisciplinary approach to plant protection by engaging in a number of activities. See <strong><a href="about.html">Aims and Activities</a></strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The drop-down menu under the IAPPS "<strong>Resources</strong><a href="">'</a> tab provides various ways in which you can access further information about plant protection.</p>
